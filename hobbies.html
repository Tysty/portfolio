              I first got into robotics when I joined my school’s robotics team in my junior year of high school. I had a lot of fun, and in my senior year, I became the lead programmer, helping the team reach the semi-finals of the regional tournament. Since then, I’ve picked up Arduino and started creating personal projects in my free time, such as a remote-controlled boat.

              I have played two campaigns in DnD and plan to be a dungeon master in the near future.
              My first character is "Nick Grime", an excommunicated paladin in the church of Beef Jesus (Jeff Bezos with the first letters swapped sounds like Beef Jesus). He is on a quest to find the holy grill, capable of taming any gamy meat that is put on it's grate.
              My second character is "Zen Ten", a monk who is traveling the seven seas in search for the "One Fleece", which can cure his severe insomnia.
